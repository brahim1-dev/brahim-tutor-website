# Tutor Website

![Tutor site preview](images/hero.png)

This is a simple static tutor website project. It contains a homepage, a contact page, styles, images, and a small JavaScript file to add interactivity.

## What I Use
- **HTML**: `index.html`, `contact.html` — structure and content of the site.
- **CSS**: `css/styles.css` — visual styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: `js/script.js` — client-side behavior and interactivity.
- **Images**: `images/` — static assets used by the site.

## How to Use / Run
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser (double-click or use your browser's Open File feature).
2. Navigate between the homepage and `contact.html` to view content.
3. Edit files locally with any text editor or IDE and refresh the browser to see changes.

## File Structure
- `index.html` — main landing page.
- `contact.html` — contact form or contact information page.
- `css/styles.css` — stylesheet for the site.
- `js/script.js` — site JavaScript.
- `images/` — folder for images and media..

## Importance / Why This Matters
- Provides a simple, clear example of a static website structure used for learning web development.
- Helps demonstrate how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build a small project.
- Useful as a starting template for personal portfolios, tutoring landing pages, or small client demos.

## Notes & Next Steps
- To extend the project, consider adding form validation, responsive improvements, or a small build step with tooling (optional).
- If you want, I can: run a quick check, add usage instructions for Git, or create a short CONTRIBUTING section.

**Image placement note:** The README references `images/hero.png`. If your attached image file has a different name, move or rename it to `images/hero.png` (or update the path above to match the actual file name)..
